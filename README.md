The objective of this project was to learn how to use maps and geographic locations

To apply that, I used the yelp API where you are able to find specific establishments in different cities around the world

It's very easy to manage, you need to put a mandatory establishment and then search. The city it's not mandatory and the program will generate an automatic one
in case the user don't specify

The search page it's this one:

I hope you enjoy :D
